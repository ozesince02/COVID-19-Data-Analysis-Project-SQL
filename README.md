# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project was undertaken for learning and practicing purposes and was inspired by a YouTube tutorial by Alex the Analyst. The goal of this project is to analyze COVID-19 data, including cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population statistics, to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic at both global and regional levels.

## Project Overview

The COVID-19 Data Analysis Project is designed to perform various analyses on COVID-19 data sourced from external datasets. The analyses are conducted using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data. The project covers the following key areas:

1. **COVID-19 Deaths Analysis**
   - Analyzing COVID-19 deaths data, including total deaths, death percentages, and death rates in specific countries and continents.
   - Identifying countries with the highest infection rates and death counts.
   
2. **COVID-19 Global Trends**
   - Examining global trends in daily new cases, daily new deaths, and daily death percentages over time.
   
3. **COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis**
   - Analyzing COVID-19 vaccination data, including new vaccinations and total vaccinations administered.
   - Calculating the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated.

## Project Structure

The project consists of SQL queries organized into several sections:

- **COVID Deaths Analysis**: Queries that focus on COVID-19 deaths, including death percentages, population infection rates, and identifying countries with high infection and death counts.

- **COVID Global Trends**: Queries that analyze global trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths over time.

- **COVID Vaccination Analysis**: Queries that examine COVID-19 vaccination data, including the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated.

- **Temporary Tables and Views**: This section includes the creation of temporary tables and a view to store and retrieve data for later visualizations.

## Instructions for Running the Project

1. Ensure you have access to the required datasets, which are not provided in this repository.

2. Import the SQL queries into your preferred SQL database management tool (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio, MySQL Workbench).

3. Execute the SQL queries one by one in the order provided to perform the desired data analysis.

4. For visualizations, you can export the query results to a visualization tool of your choice (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) or create custom visualizations as needed.

## Data Sources

- The project utilizes external datasets for COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations. These datasets are not included in this repository and should be obtained from reliable sources.
